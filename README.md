# Hybrid Network Topology using Scilab

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a **Hybrid Network Topology** using **Scilab**.  
The topology is created by combining **Star, Tree, and Ring** topologies and is visualized using graphical plotting techniques. The experiment also includes analysis of node degrees, total nodes, and total edges.

This work is part of the **Computer Networks Laboratory**.

##  Aim
To design and visualize a **hybrid network topology** using Scilab and to analyze the network by:
- Displaying the topology
- Numbering nodes
- Colouring nodes and edges
- Computing node degrees
- Identifying the node with maximum connections
- Calculating total nodes and edges

---

## Tools Used
- **Scilab (Version 6.x)**
- **Windows Operating System**
- **Graph theory concepts**
- **Adjacency Matrix representation**

---

##  Topologies Used
- **Star Topology** 
- **Tree Topology** 
- **Ring Topology** 

These topologies are interconnected to form a **Hybrid Topology** suitable for a campus network.

---

## Implementation Details
- The network consists of **26 nodes**
- An **adjacency matrix** is used to represent connections
- Nodes are positioned using predefined coordinates
- Separate visualization windows are created for:
  - Plain topology
  - Numbered topology
  - Coloured topology
  - Final combined view
- Node degree and network statistics are printed in the console

---


## How to Run
1. Install **Scilab** from https://www.scilab.org  
2. Open Scilab and create a new script file  
3. Copy the contents of `Hybrid_Star_Tree_Ring.sce` into the editor  
4. Run the script (F5)  
5. Observe the graphical windows and console output

---

## Output
- Visual representation of the hybrid topology
- Colour-coded nodes and edges
- Node numbering for easy identification
- Console output showing:
  - Degree of each node
  - Node with maximum edges
  - Total number of nodes and edges

---

## Conclusion
The experiment successfully demonstrates the creation and analysis of a **hybrid network topology** using Scilab. By combining star, tree, and ring topologies, the network achieves better scalability, reliability, and efficient communication, making it suitable for real-world applications such as campus networks.
